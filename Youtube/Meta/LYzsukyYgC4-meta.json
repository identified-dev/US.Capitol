  "description": "Pro-Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building in Washington DC on Wednesday, breaking into the debating chambers and clashing with armed police. Four people died during the unrest, three from medical emergencies and one woman was shot dead in circumstances that are unclear. The siege came on the day the electoral college votes confirming Joe Biden\u0027s victory were to be affirmed by members of the House and Senate. The chaos erupted after Trump addressed thousands of protesters near the White House, repeating false claims the election had been stolen. \n\nSubscribe to Guardian News on YouTube ► http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub\n\nCongress debates challenges to election results after pro-Trump mob invades Capitol – live ► https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jan/06/georgia-election-latest-news-senate-ossoff-warnock-democrats-republicans-trump-biden\n\nAmerica shaken after pro-Trump mob storms US Capitol building ► https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-mob-capitol-clash-police-washington\n\nSupport the Guardian ► https://support.theguardian.com/contribute\n\nToday in Focus podcast ► https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/todayinfocus\n\nThe Guardian YouTube network:\n\nThe Guardian ► http://www.youtube.com/theguardian\nGuardian Football ► http://is.gd/guardianfootball\nGuardian Sport ► http://bit.ly/GDNsport\nGuardian Culture ► http://is.gd/guardianculture",
